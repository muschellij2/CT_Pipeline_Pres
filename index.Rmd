## Goals of the Analysis

1.  Register patient CT scans to a CT template
2.  Create a 3D density map of hemorrhages occur in a population of 111 patients with ICH (MISTIE and ICH), 
3.  Quantify hemorrhage engagement with atlases 
4.  Determine if differences in location relate to NIHSS

## Outstanding Questions

1.  Does left/right matter?
2.  How "fine/coarse" should the description of a clot be?
3.  Are there other methods not discussed in paper (i.e. Steve Cramer)?
4.  How does this relate to Rankin Score at 30/90/180?
    * The problem with this is randomization
    * Maybe look at this within the Medical group
